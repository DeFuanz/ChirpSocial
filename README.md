When Twitter Fails, Chirp Prevails

Chirp is a Mock-twitter style web-app created with razorpages as a school project.

**How Chirp Works**
The project requires the user to select a profile at from the landing page. After selection, the pages continue to pass around a "profileId" as the user navigates through the feed, new post, delete, and post details pages. This allows the user to make new posts, access edit and delete for only their posts, as well as leave comments under their name without needing to manually select or input their profile information

**Lessons Learned**
As the project scaled I quickly ran into project creep as well as getting lines of codes less organized as well as html and bootstrap elements mixed in that may not even do anything (ex: using too many divs or irrelevant class tags). With the project creep, i kept adding features only to realize i wanted to add other features, or change how the features located. Overall, I started to get less organized as the project grew more complex. For future projects, I need to plan accordingly as well as keep code combined in chunks that arerelevant to each other for easier reading. 

**Going Forward**
The project is not at all perfect. With that, I would really like to continue woorking on is to expand my knowledge with ASP.NET. This includes, but not limited to:
-Cleaning and Organizing the Code
-Learning and implementing authentication to replace passing user id variables
-Relocating some features such as the new post function to go under the profile area on the feed page
-Reply count indicators on each post to show how many replies it has before clicking on in.
-More to be added
